// Point Distance

// Write a JS class that represents a Point. It has x and y coordinates as properties, 
// that are set through the constructor, and a static method for finding the distance between two points, called distance().

// Input
// The distance() method should receive two Point objects as parameters.

// Output
// The distance() method should return a number, the distance between the two-point parameters.
// Submit the class definition as is, without wrapping it in any function.

// Input                                           Output

// let p1 = new Point(5, 5);
// let p2 = new Point(9, 8);
// console.log(Point.distance(p1, p2));            5
